# machine that is actually slow.
#
# It used to be off unless KARA_DEBUG_LOG was set, which meant the two people who
# reported the app was slow had recorded nothing at all: neither of them was ever
# going to run setx before using a dictation tool. A measurement nobody takes is
# not a cautious measurement, it is an absent one.
#
# What makes always-on acceptable is what the file holds. Timings, sizes and
# device names. Never what anybody said: the transcript is not passed in, and the

# way. A file that cannot leak speech is worth more than one with a redaction

        was a hard rectangle while its own website was all soft corners. Drawing
        rounded cards inside it did not fix that; it just put a second rectangle
        inside the first one.

        Two ways to get the shape, and which one runs depends on the version:

          DWM, on Windows 11. The compositor rounds it, so the edge is
          antialiased and it matches every other window on the desktop.

          SetWindowRgn, on Windows 10. Clips the window to a rounded rectangle.
          The corners are aliased because a region is a hard mask, but a slightly
          jagged curve reads better than no curve, and 10 has no other option.

        Failing is fine. A square window is the status quo, not a bug, so every
