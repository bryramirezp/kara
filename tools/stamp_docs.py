    py -3 tools/stamp_docs.py           fix the files in place
    py -3 tools/stamp_docs.py --check   fail if any of them is stale

The version lives in exactly one place, __version__ in kara.py, and the
installer's size is whatever the installer happens to weigh. Everywhere else
that mentions either is a copy, and copies go stale quietly -- the JSON-LD on
the website sat at 0.1.0 for three releases before anyone noticed. This walks
the copies and rewrites them from the originals.

It is idempotent: running it twice changes nothing the second time, which is
what lets --check work by running it against a scratch copy and comparing.

Not everything here is derived. The speech model's size is a property of the
model, not of a build, so it is a constant below and only moves when the
default model does.

packaging/build.py calls this after it builds, so a normal release picks the
new numbers up on its own.
