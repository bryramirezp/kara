## What it does

You hold down a key. You talk. You let go. A moment later your words appear in
whatever app you were using — your browser, Word, a chat, anywhere you can type.

It uses [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) to turn speech
into text. Everything happens on your own computer. Your voice is never sent
anywhere, and you can unplug the internet and it still works.

People usually find this while looking for a **free alternative to Dragon
NaturallySpeaking**, an **offline speech to text tool for Windows**, or something
better than **Windows Voice Typing (Win+H)**, which needs an internet connection
and sends your audio to Microsoft.

| | Kara | Windows Voice Typing | Dragon | Otter.ai |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Price | Free | Free | Paid | Free tier, then paid |
| Works offline | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Needs an account | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Types into any app | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Voice commands | No | Some | Yes | No |
| Open source | Yes | No | No | No |

Dragon is bought mostly for driving a computer by voice, and this does not do
that. It dictates text, and that part is free and works with no connection.

## Download

**[Download the installer](https://github.com/bryramirezp/kara/releases/download/v0.3.2/Kara-Setup-0.3.2.exe)**
— <!--dl-size-->77 MB<!--/dl-size-->, for Windows 10 and 11. The link starts the download straight away.

Have an NVIDIA graphics card? There is a second, much larger installer that
carries the CUDA libraries with it:
**[Download the GPU installer](https://github.com/bryramirezp/kara/releases/download/v0.3.2/Kara-Setup-GPU-0.3.2.exe)**
— <!--dl-size-gpu-->576 MB<!--/dl-size-gpu-->. Same app, same settings; it just
also knows how to use the card. Take the ordinary one if you are not sure — it
works everywhere, and you can install the other over the top of it later.

Run it and you are done. You do not need to install Python or anything else.

> The installer is not signed, so Windows may show a blue box that says
> "Windows protected your PC". Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
> Signing costs money every year, which is a lot for a free tool.

The first time you open the app it downloads the speech model, about 460 MB.
This happens once. After that it works offline.

## How to use it

1. Hold **Insert** and speak.
2. Let go. Your words are typed where your cursor is.
3. Click the **⚙** button to change anything.

The app hides near the clock. Click that icon to bring it back.

To start it with Windows, tick the box during install. If you missed it, press
`Win+R`, type `shell:startup`, and drop a shortcut to the app in that folder.

## Settings

<img src="docs/screenshot-settings-light.png" alt="The settings panel" width="300">

| Setting | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **Appearance** | Light or dark. Changes right away. |
| **Hotkey** | The key you hold to record. Extra mouse buttons work too. |
| **Microphone** | Leave it on auto unless you have several and want a specific one. |
| **Language** | Automatic detects the language of each dictation. Picking a language can improve accuracy, especially on short clips. |
| **Device** | Your processor, or your graphics card if you have an NVIDIA one. The installer only offers the processor — see below. |
| **Model** | Bigger models are more accurate but slower. |

### About the hotkey

Do not pick a normal letter or number. The app does not block the key, so if you
choose `q`, every `q` you type will start a recording. Good choices are `Insert`,
the `F13`–`F24` keys, or a side button on your mouse.

## Using a graphics card

There are two installers. The ordinary one runs on your processor: it is small,
it works on any machine, and on a long dictation it is the slow one. The GPU
installer carries the CUDA libraries, which is why it is about eight times
larger, and on an NVIDIA card it is not a small difference.

If you have an NVIDIA card, take
[the GPU installer](https://github.com/bryramirezp/kara/releases/download/v0.3.2/Kara-Setup-GPU-0.3.2.exe).
You need nothing else — no CUDA Toolkit, no separate download; whatever version
of the Toolkit you may already have installed is not used. A current graphics
driver is the only requirement.

You can install either one over the other. They are the same program and they
share their settings.

**AMD and Intel cards are not supported yet.** ctranslate2, the engine
underneath, has no backend for them on Windows, so Kara falls back to your
processor and there is nothing in Settings that would change that. It is being
worked on.

Whichever build you have, **Device → auto** does the right thing: the card if it
is usable, the processor if it is not. The **gpu** option only appears where the
CUDA libraries are really present, so it can no longer be a button that breaks
the app.

### Running from source with a card

```bat
git clone https://github.com/bryramirezp/kara.git
cd kara
py -3 -m pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
launch.bat
```

## Running from source

You need Python 3.10 or newer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Tick "Add python.exe to PATH" while installing it.

```bat
py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
launch.bat
```

`launch.bat` starts the app with no window. To see errors while you work on it,
run `py -3 kara.py` instead.

If you keep your packages in one specific Python, tell the launcher which one:

```bat
setx KARA_PYTHON "C:\Path\To\pythonw.exe"
```

Your settings live in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kara\settings.json`.

To rebuild the icons after changing the drawing in the app:

```bat
py -3 tools/make_logo.py
```

## Questions

### Does it work offline?

Yes. The first run downloads the speech model, about 460 MB. After that it never
needs the internet again.

### Is it free?

Yes, and open source under the MIT license. No account, no subscription, no
trial that runs out.

### Is this a free alternative to Dragon NaturallySpeaking?

For dictation, yes. It does not replace Dragon's voice commands for controlling
Windows by voice.

### How is it different from Windows Voice Typing (Win+H)?

Windows Voice Typing sends your audio to Microsoft and needs a connection. This
runs on your own machine, works with no connection at all, and lets you pick a
larger and more accurate model.

### Which languages does it support?

Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, German and Italian.

### Do I need a graphics card?

No. The ordinary download runs on your processor and works on any machine. If
you have an NVIDIA card there is a separate, larger installer that uses it; see
[Using a graphics card](#using-a-graphics-card).

## Dictating numbers and punctuation

In 0.3.2, **Automatic** is back and is the default for new settings; upgrades
keep your existing language choice. Switch between Spanish and English
dictations without changing Settings. Mixing languages in one recording can
cause errors, including omitted or translated passages. Selecting a fixed
language can improve accuracy, especially on short clips.

Automatic keeps the punctuation and numbers supplied by Whisper. Kara only
cleans up spacing and capitalization: it does not add Spanish opening marks
based on the first language detected. Kara's additional number conversions and
spoken commands described below require a **fixed language**. Their settings
are preserved while disabled in Automatic.

Numbers are typed as numbers. Say "mil doscientos pesos" and you get
`1200 pesos`; "son las tres cuarenta y cinco" gives `son las 3:45`; "un veinte
por ciento" gives `un 20%`. A bare "un", "una" or "uno" is left as a word, since
they are articles far more often than they are the number.

For punctuation, say the name of the mark:

| Say | Get |
| --- | --- |
| punto y aparte | a new paragraph |
| nueva linea | a line break |
| abre parentesis / cierra parentesis | ( ) |
| signo de interrogacion | ? |
| dos puntos | : |
| punto y coma | ; |
| arroba | @ |

These are all phrases nobody says by accident. Plain "coma" and "punto" are
ordinary Spanish words -- "el punto de partida", "la coma va aca" -- so they are
off by default. Settings -> TEXT has a switch that turns them on, and another
that turns the whole thing off.

## Your privacy

- Your voice never leaves your computer.
- The microphone is only on while you hold the key. The rest of the time it is
  closed, so nothing is listening.
- The text is pasted with the clipboard, and whatever text you had copied before
  is put back afterwards. An image or a copied file cannot be handed back
  through the clipboard, so in that case the dictated text is left there instead.
- Kara keeps a log of how long each dictation took, in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kara\trace.jsonl`. It holds timings, model and device
  names, and how many characters came out — never a word of what you said, and
  there is no setting that would make it record that. It is capped at 2 MB and
  the oldest entries are dropped.
- **Nothing is sent anywhere.** Kara contains no network code beyond downloading
  the speech model on first run. If you ever want to send me that log to explain
  why the app is slow on your machine, Settings → Export diagnostics packs it
  into a zip and opens the folder, and you decide what happens to the file.
